          Everything started with the interest to write logical code and passion
          about web and graphics design. I have been making websites since early
          days of my school when frames, tables, and animated GIFs were the
          coolest things to design.

          I’ve been specializing in full-stack web development, WordPress, and
          responsive design for several years now, and enjoy a good coding
          challenge.

          I got my first commercial project in 2013 and my journey as web
          developer started. Then I decide to specialize in web application and
          took admission in Internet Applications and Web Development course in
          London, Ontario. I did many freelance projects while I was studying.

          I like to study new technologies in web and also like to teach as
          well. Due to my interest of teaching, I was peer tutor at my college
          helping other students to meet their academics goals.

          After my studies in Web Applications I stated working for web agency
          Marketing Strategies and Solutions. I worked there for 3+ years and
          polished my web and graphics designs skills. When I started working
          for web agency I didn’t know anything about Wordpress, but with 3+
          years of experience I am now Wordpress expert.

          In 2018 I moved to USA for better opputunities and looks like it was
          right move.
